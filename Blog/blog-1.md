## The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

### Overview:
<p>In TypeScript, union and crossing point sorts are effective highlights that upgrade the expressiveness and adaptability of the sort framework. Let's break down their centrality: </p>

<summary><b>Union Types: </b><p>Union sorts permit you to pronounce that a variable can hold values of diverse sorts. This can be especially valuable when a work or variable can acknowledge more than one sort of input. For Example: </p></summary>


```bash
function displayData(data: string | number) {
    console.log(data);
}

displayData("Hello"); 
displayData(123);     
displayData(true);
```
<p>Union sorts are profitable for dealing with scenarios where a esteem can change in sort, such as when managing with client input or APIs that return distinctive sorts of information beneath distinctive circumstances.</p>

<summary><b>Intersection Types: </b> <p>Intersection Types permit you to combine multiple types into a single sort. This can be valuable after you need an object to have the characteristics of numerous sorts at the same time. For Example: </p></summary>


```bash
interface Printable {
    print(): void;
}

interface Loggable {
    log(): void;
}

function createLogger(): Printable & Loggable {
    return {
        print() {
            console.log("Printing...");
        },
        log() {
            console.log("Logging...");
        }
    };
}

const logger = createLogger();
logger.print(); 
logger.log();   
```
<p>Crossing point sorts empower you to form more adaptable and reusable code by combining existing sorts in other ways. They are particularly valuable when working with mixins, where you need to combine behaviors from different sources into a single object.</p>

### summary:
<p>In outline, union and crossing point sorts are critical in TypeScript since they give designers with devices to show complex information structures and behaviors in a type-safe way, coming about in more vigorous and viable code.</p>
